# Specs

This folder contains implementation-ready specifications derived from `docs/README.md` and `docs/architecture/*`.

These specs aim to be:
- Deterministic (especially parsing/indexing rules)
- Privacy-first (local-only by default; explicit opt-in for external calls)
- Source-of-truth aligned (Markdown vault is the note content authority)
