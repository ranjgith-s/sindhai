# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Use ADRs to record important choices and tradeoffs as the implementation starts.

## Workflow

- Create a new file `docs/decisions/NNNN-title.md` using the template.
- Keep it short: context, decision, consequences.
- Link from relevant architecture docs if needed.
